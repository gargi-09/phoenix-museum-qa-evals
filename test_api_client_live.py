"""
MAKE SURE TO USE THE CORRECT ENV VARIABLE NAME BEFORE RUNNING!!

test_api_client_live.py -- Tests the REAL call_haiku() function from
api_client.py against httpbin.org (a public echo/status-simulation
service), WITHOUT ever touching real credentials or your actual
.env file.

HOW THIS STAYS SAFE:
- Fake credentials are set via os.environ DIRECTLY, in this script's own
  process memory only -- never written to .env, never touched on disk.
- python-dotenv's load_dotenv() (called inside api_client.py) does NOT
  override variables that already exist in os.environ by default -- so
  as long as we set our fake values BEFORE importing api_client, our
  fakes take precedence over anything (or nothing) in your real .env,
  for the lifetime of this script's process only.
- This test script never reads or writes your real .env file at all.

WHAT THIS TESTS: the actual network request/response handling in
api_client.py's call_haiku() -- headers, payload shape, status-code
classification, retry timing -- using httpbin.org as a stand-in server.
It CANNOT test the real response schema (content shape, usage
field names, etc.) since httpbin.org just echoes/simulates status codes,
it doesn't know anything about actual response format.

Usage: python test_api_client_live.py
