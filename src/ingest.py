ingest.py -- Loads and normalizes the museum corpus.

Handles two source formats:
  - "structured": fields already separated, needs cleaning/normalization only
  - "semi_structured": everything in one raw_text blob, needs pattern-based
    extraction (3 deterministic regex patterns cover 98.2% of these for free;
    the small residual is flagged for a one-time LLM fallback call, not
    executed here since this module has no network dependency by design --
    see extract_via_llm_fallback() for the extension point).

Output: a single normalized JSONL file where every record has the same
shape, regardless of source format, ready for the retrieval layer.

    root cause of every extraction failure in this corpus: all 7 records that
    fall through have accession_number == '' (empty string, not missing), so
    both patterns bail before looking at text they could actually parse. The
    accession was never load-bearing for finding title/artist -- pattern B
    already locates the year by regex and splits around THAT -- so anchoring on
    the year removes the dependency entirely.

    WHY IT MATTERS BEYOND TIDINESS. Those 7 records had title, artist, medium
    and classification all None, which left their retrieval passage as raw
    prose. Measured consequence: BM25 ranked each one #1 of 5,000 for a query
    drawn from its own text, while the dense encoder ranked them 3,952-4,971
    of 5,000, so Reciprocal Rank Fusion buried all 7 outside the top 10 and
    they were effectively unreachable. Populating the structured fields fixes
    the retrieval failure as a side effect, because the passage then starts
    with distinctive title/artist text like every healthy record.

         - '</em' with the closing '>' missing entirely
       All three are genuine markup corruption with no real content inside
       them -- safe to strip outright.

    IMPORTANT -- things that look like broken tags but are NOT: one title,
    'Ansichten >82<' (appearing identically across two independent records,
    different institutions), is the artist's actual intentional title
    styling (Hanne Darboven's practice centers on numeric/calendar
    notation) -- verified via cross-referencing before concluding this, and
    deliberately NOT touched by any of the patterns below, since none of
    them match on angle brackets adjacent to digits rather than letters.

    Handling: strip tags/fragments entirely rather than trying to render
    them -- for broken link tags this removes URL noise that would
    otherwise pollute embeddings/retrieval with meaningless text; for
    inline formatting tags this correctly preserves the real word while
    dropping markup we have no use for.
