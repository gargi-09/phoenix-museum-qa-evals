# agreeing: this endpoint discards a separately-supplied system prompt.

# two are kept because this is one endpoint's behaviour, not a law.

    5,380 tokens for a single question instead of 2,690. So this was never
    a cosmetic false positive; it roughly halved the usable call count
    against a fixed budget.

    Stripping the fence is NOT merely suppressing the signal -- the fence
    state is itself real evidence, and using it makes detection strictly
    better rather than just quieter:
      - A CLOSED fence proves the model emitted its final delimiter, so the
        response reached its intended end and the INNER content is what

      - An UNCLOSED fence means the closing delimiter never arrived, which

    0.98 blocked call 2 onward, permanently, after a perfectly good call 1.
    A guard that bricks the entire pipeline on an unverified guess is worse
    than the reactive-402 gap it was written to close.

    RULE: accept only non-negative integral numerics. Anything else is
    un-interpretable, and the caller FAILS OPEN (proceeds, relying on
    reactive 402 handling) rather than fail-closed.

    truncation detection and single truncation retry, same token tracking.

    Differences from the proxy path, each deliberate:
      - The system prompt goes in the top-level `system` field. The Anthropic
        API honours it, so MESSAGE_FORMAT=prepend (a workaround for a proxy
        that dropped it) does not apply.
      - No temperature. Claude Haiku 5.5 rejects any non-default sampling
        parameter with a 400, and so does every model on API version
        2026-10-21. Determinism comes from the prompt and the JSON contract.
      - Thinking stays on (the model's default) at low effort, with headroom
        added to max_tokens so thinking cannot crowd out the answer. Thinking
        blocks are skipped when assembling `content`.
      - A `refusal` stop reason is an error, not an answer: Haiku 5.5's safety
        classifiers can decline, and there is no server-side fallback for it.
